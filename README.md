# MD5-Checksum-Matcher
A small program where you input two checksums and see if they match


Open the command prompt
cd into the folder that holds the file you want to checksum
Enter the command:
certutil -hashfile <file> MD5
replace <file> with filename
Press Enter


Copy the MD5 checksum from the provider and cmd prompt and check if they match.
If they do then your download went through properly.
